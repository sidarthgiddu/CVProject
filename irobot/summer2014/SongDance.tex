\section{Overview}

We would like to program an iRobts to sing and dance based on the gestural input from a human conductor. We first use a camera and a laptop to capture and process human gestures and translate them into corresponding iRobot commands. Then these commands are communicated wirelessly from the laptop to a Galileo platform linked to the iRobot. Upon receiving the commands, Galileo in turn controls and coordinates the motion and audio of the iRobot.

\section{Steps}

\textbf{Week 1-2}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use a laptop to program the iRobot to sing and move around by connecting to the iRobot using the serial interface cable.

\item Connect the power and serial communication interface between iRobot and Galileo. [\href{http://www.instructables.com/id/Voice-Controlled-iRobot-Create/?ALLSTEPS}{Link to complete tutorial}] [\href{https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/57}{Link to power supply tutorial}]

\item Set up the Arduino development environment and use Galileo to direct the iRobot to sing a short piece of music and move around based on the rhythm of the music.

\end{itemize}
\textbf{Week 3-4}

\begin{itemize}
\item Set up wireless connectivity on Intel Galileo and test communication between laptop and Galileo through either WIFI or Bluetooth. [\href{http://ionospherics.com/intel-galileo-setting-up-wifi/}{Link to tutorial}]

\item Investigate available open-source gesture recognition libraries. Check if there are MATLAB gesture recognition toolboxes available.

[\href{http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/26280/Hands-Gesture-Recognition}{Link to C++ library by Andrew Kirillov}]

\item Test gesture recognition on laptop to detect simple hand gestures using webcam. Send detected gestures wirelessly to Galileo.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Week 5-6}
\begin{itemize}
\item Program Galileo to receive gestures and react by sending corresponding commands to the iRobot. Create a complete song and dance routine that can be controlled by gestures.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Week 7-8}
\begin{itemize}
\item Prepare documentation, presentation, and final report.


%\item Become familiar with iRobot controls using the Matlab simulator by experimenting with the introductory projects from CS 1112 course.
%\item Use Galileo to program the iRobot to play a simple piece of music.
%\item Use Galileo to program the iRobot to perform simple motions such as moving forward or backward, turning left or right, rotating, etc.
%\item Study gesture detection from computer vision and write C code to detect simple hand gestures and translate them into iRobot commands.
%\item Implement the gesture detection algorithm on FPGA using HLS.
%\item Implement the Bluetooth interface between FPGA and Galileo.
%\item Modify the program on Galileo to use commands received from the FPGA to control the iRobot.
\end{itemize}

\section{FAQs}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Why does the iRobot not start moving after I issue a 153 (play script) command in the script?} Your 153 (play script) may have been included as part of your script to make it loop. Check the length of your script to see whether it is included. If so, you need to issue another 153 (play script) command outside of the script to actually execute the script.

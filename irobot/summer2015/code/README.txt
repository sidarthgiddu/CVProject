(1) Arduino_Side_Command_Reception: This code is used to upload on Arduino. By uploading the code, arduino will be able to host server, wifi network and able to communicate with iRobot
(2) FPGA_HLS_Heterogeneous_Computing: This code is used to program FPGA to do video gesture recogntion and command sending
(3) Visual_Studio_Object_Detection_Code: This is software version of video gesture recogntion. Platform is Visual studio + OpenCV. 
    To run the project open iRobot_OpenCV.sln in visual studio 2013.
(4) Processing_Keyboard_Control_to_Control_iRobot (OPTIONAL): This was for prototyping. Not needed.
